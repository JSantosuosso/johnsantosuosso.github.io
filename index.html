    <div class="project">
      <h2>Mandalorian Wrist‑Mounted Flame Thrower</h2>
      <p>A wearable wrist-mounted flamethrower system inspired by Mandalorian armor. Integrated fuel delivery, ignition control, and safety mechanisms built into a forearm-mounted housing. CAD‑designed, fabricated, and tested for controlled flame projection.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <h2>Cephalobot – Soft Robotic Squid</h2>
      <p>A soft‑robotic biomimetic squid using silicone molding, distributed pneumatic actuation, and flexible linkages. Designed to replicate cephalopod‑like undulating motion for research in soft robotics and underwater locomotion.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <h2>VT CRO Trimodal Robot</h2>
      <p>A multifunctional robot for the Center for Research in Ocean Engineering at Virginia Tech. Capable of walking, rolling, and swimming through a trimodal actuation architecture. Contributed design, modeling, and mechanical integration.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <h2>Follow‑Me Drone</h2>
      <p>An autonomous quadcopter using computer vision and GPS‑assisted tracking to follow a target user. Features onboard ESP32‑based communication, PID control loops, and custom‑designed tracking algorithms.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <h2>e‑Nable @ Virginia Tech – Low‑Cost Prosthetic Hand</h2>
